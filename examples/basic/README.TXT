The BASIC examples included here are taken from the 'Add programmable
Sound Effects to Your Computer' article in the July 1982 issue of BYTE
magazine (pp. 60-72). Note that since the 6502 uses memory mapped i/o,
the OUT statements have been replaced with POKE. All examples use the
PAL-1 Digital Complex Sound Generator default base address (ie. $16EE,
5870 dec).
